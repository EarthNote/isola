GREEN

To calculate Green functions and elementary seismograms.


1. Provide CRUSTAL.DAT, i.e. an 1D horizontally latered model 
of the medium. Follow comments in the sample file.

2. Provide  STATION.DAT (copy from directory SOURSTAT).

3. Provide trial source positions SRC01.DAT, SRC02.DAT, ...
(copy from directory SOURSTAT)

4.  Provide auxiliary parameters for Green's fctn,
calculation in GRDAT.HED. See and edit sample file.
Edit only this: 
 nc...number of layers from CRUSTAL.DAT
 nfreq... number of frequencies to be computed; then
          maximum calculated frequency is nfreq * df,
          where the frequency step is df=1./tl
 tl ... the time window length (in sec), it must be         
        tl=8192 * dt, where dt is the time step 
        of the XXXRAW.DAT input waveform files 
 nr ... number of all stations in ALLSTAT.DAT
 xl ... this number should be larger than 20 * epimax,
        where epimax is max.epic. distance (in meters !)
 
 
5. Calculate Green fctns. for the trial source positions.
   Use GRE_25.BAT. If you need more then 25 trial sources,
   or less, edit GRE_25.BAT (add or remove some lines).
   Sample data are for 3 trial sources, see GRE_3.BAT.
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

6. Calculate elementary seismograms. Use ELE_25.BAT.
   Elemseis are seismograms for 5 basic focal mechanisms
   (that cannot be changed),and for a given moment rate
   time fctn. Present version makes use of delta fctn.
   Time fctn. cannot be changed unless the user makes
   a small edit of ELEMSE.FOR to select, e.g. a triangle.
   Sample data are for 3 trial sources, see ELE_3.BAT.
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????   

7. Elemseis come in files numbered according the trial sources,
   ELEMSE01.DAT, ELEMSE02.DAT, ..for trial source 1, 2, ....
   i.e. one file for one source and all stations
   (the station succession same as in STATION.DAT).
   Sample ELEMSExx.DAT files are not distributed with this
   package due to their length.
   
8. Go to directory INVERT.
